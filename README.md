E‑Commerce Electronics Store Project
Project Overview
This project is a static e‑commerce website for selling electronics, built using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project is to simulate a real‑world software development environment where students collaborate remotely using GitHub.
The website will showcase an electronics store with multiple pages such as a homepage, product listings, and contact/about pages. Each team member is responsible for coding one complete page, including its HTML and CSS files.
This project focuses on frontend structure, styling, teamwork, and Git version control, rather than backend functionality.

Team Members

Each member owns a specific page and is responsible for maintaining and updating that page throughout the project.

Project Goals
Build a clean and responsive electronics e‑commerce store UI
Practice collaborative coding using GitHub
Understand how real development teams work remotely
Improve HTML and CSS structuring skills
Learn Git workflows such as branching, pushing, pulling, and merging

Website Pages & Responsibilities
Each student codes one page, with its own HTML and CSS file:

GitHub Collaboration & Learning Outcomes
This project helps students develop practical Git skills, including:
1. Git Clone, Pull & Push
Cloning a remote repository
Pulling the latest updates from the team
Pushing personal changes to GitHub
2. Branching & Page Ownership
Each student works on their own branch
Prevents code conflicts
Encourages independent problem‑solving
3. Pull Requests & Code Review
Changes are reviewed before merging
Encourages clean code and accountability
4. Working With main Branch
Students learn why pushing directly to main is risky
Code is merged into main only after review
Demonstrates industry best practices
These skills are essential for real‑world software development and internships.

GitHub Workflow Used
Pull latest changes from main
Create a feature branch for your page
Code your assigned page (HTML & CSS)
Commit changes with clear messages
Push branch to GitHub
Open a Pull Request
Team lead reviews and merges into main
